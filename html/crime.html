    <h1>What is Crime?</h1>
    <h3>Written by: Emerald Mendez, 2024</h3>
    <p>A crime is an unlawful act defined by a country's legal system as harmful to individuals, society, or the state. It can involve actions
	like theft or assault or the failure to act when required by law such as neglect of duties. Crimes are categorized based on their severity, 
	such as misdemeanors which are less serious offenses like vandalism and felonies which are serious offenses like murder. When someone commits 
	a crime, they may face penalties such as fines, imprisonment, community service, or other legal consequences, determined through a judicial process.
