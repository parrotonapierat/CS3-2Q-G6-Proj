    <h1>What is Crime?</h1>
    <h3>Written by: Emerald Mendez, 2024</h3>
    <p>A crime is an unlawful act defined by a country's legal system as harmful to individuals, society, or the state. It can involve actions
	like theft or assault or the failure to act when required by law such as neglect of duties. Crimes are categorized based on their severity, 
	such as misdemeanors which are less serious offenses like vandalism and felonies which are serious offenses like murder. When someone commits 
	a crime, they may face penalties such as fines, imprisonment, community service, or other legal consequences, determined through a judicial process.

        </div>
        <p class="case-summary">One of the most well-known cases of murder is the O.J. Simpson murder trial in the United States. In 1994, O.J.
		Simpson was accused of murdering his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ron Goldman. Despite strong evidence, including DNA 
		and a bloody glove, he was acquitted in a highly publicized trial. However, in a later civil case, Simpson was found liable for their 
		wrongful deaths and ordered to pay damages. The case remains a significant example of how legal outcomes can differ in criminal and civil courts.
